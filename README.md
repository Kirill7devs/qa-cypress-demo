# Cypress QA Automation Demo

This project contains real use-case examples of Cypress-based E2E testing:

- Login flow with session caching
- Creating and removing staff, offers, announcements, and salons
- Usage of `cy.session()` and `Cypress.Commands.add()`
- Clean structure with `/e2e` tests and shared `/support/commands.js`
- Tests use `data-cy` attributes for best selector practices
